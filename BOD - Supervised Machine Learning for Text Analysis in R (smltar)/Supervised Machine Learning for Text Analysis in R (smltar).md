In natural language processing, **word embedding** is a term used for the representation of words for text analysis, typically in the form of a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word such that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning.

Word embeddings can be obtained using a set of language modeling and feature learning techniques where **words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers**.
